These files are the algebraic neural network library.
In "ReLUMPsolvable.v", we show the formal proofs of an upper and lower bounds of expressive number of single hidden layer ReLU neural networks.
"Expressive number" is a measure of expressive power of neural netoworks introduced in the paper:
"Expressive power of neural networks by the number of data that can be expressed".

This paper is written in Japanese, but the definition of expressive number in English is written in "Expressive Number of Two or More Hidden Layer ReLU Neural Networks".
