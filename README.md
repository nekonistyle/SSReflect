Coq 8.8.1

These code are the formal proofs of an upper and lower bounds of expressive number of single hidden layer ReLU neural networks.
"Expressive number" is a measure of expressive power of neural netoworks introduced in "Expressive power of neural networks by the number of data that can be expressed".
